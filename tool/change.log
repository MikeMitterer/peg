0.0.1 Initial release
0.0.2 Small fixes in `bin/peg.dart`
0.0.3 Added an example of the usage of a simple `arithmetic` grammar
0.0.3 Added an example of the usage of a simple `arithmetic` grammar
0.0.6 Fixed bug in the original peg grammar in `COMMENT`
0.0.7 Minor improvements in the expression generators (reduction of the `break` statements)
0.0.8 Medium improvements of performance by reducing restrictions on the prediction on optional rules without semantic actions
0.0.9 Fixed bugs (the character code units are not an Unicode characters)
0.0.9 Parser now supports the Unicode characters (uses 32-bit runes instead of 16-bit code units) 
0.0.10 Bug fixes for the full support of the Unicode characters
0.0.11 Restored the previous performance (which has been decreased due to the support of the Unicode characters) through the addition of a pre-generated ASCII strings table.  
0.0.12 Minor bug fixes
0.0.12 Added new parser generator: interpreter parser
0.0.15 Added instruction optimizer in the interpreter parser
0.0.15 Breaking change: All methods, except the starting rules, are now private methods in all parsers. This is done for the interoperability of the generated parsers, better error messaging and performance improvement of parsing processes.
0.0.15 Added the subordination of terminals (master, slave, master/slave). In some cases this can helps developers to writing (after the analysing) grammar better and, also, this helps for the generator to better optimize the grammar and helps to improve error messages.
0.0.16 Was improved the basic ("expectation") error messages
0.0.16 Added initial support of the tokens for improving the errors messages and support of the upcomming AST generator.
0.0.18 Fixed bug in `AndPredicateExpressionGenerator` (was missed character `;` in the template after refactoring) 
0.0.19 Fixed bug in `CharacterClassExpressionGenerator`
0.0.19 Added full functional example of json parser
0.0.20 Fixed bugs in `ExpectationResolver` (error messages about the expected lexemes are now more correct)
0.0.20 Added statistics about an auto generated names of the terminals (they used in the error messages). This feature useful for correcting grammar for better perception of the components of the grammar
0.0.21 Removed convention on a naming terminals and nonterminals in favor to the possibility of analyzing (and control) the grammar on the subject of the auto generated representation names of terminals
0.0.21 Fixed bug in `_matchString`
0.0.23 Breaking change. Removed 'line' and 'column' properties.
0.0.23 Added function `errors() => List<ParserError>`.
0.0.23 Started the improvements of the error messages. From now all the parser errors are an instances of `XxxParserError` type.
0.0.23 Refactored the entire codebase for easiest implementing several kinds of parser generators.
